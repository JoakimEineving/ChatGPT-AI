        <h2>About ChatGPT AI</h2>
        <p>
          ChatGPT AI, utilizes the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 language
          model to provide users with a seamless and intuitive chat experience.
          By integrating the chatbot into this website, users can simply type out
          their inquiries or prompts and receive relevant and accurate responses
          in real-time.
          <br />
          <br />
          Not only does ChatGPT AI provide quick and accurate answers to user
          questions, but it also has the ability to carry out tasks and actions
          through natural language processing. This allows for an even more
          efficient and user-friendly experience. I implemented ChatGPT API
          using JavaScript and integrated it into the website using HTML and
          CSS. One of the key features of ChatGPT AI is its ability to
          understand and respond to natural language input. This means that
          users can communicate with the chatbot just as they would with a
          human, using normal phrases and sentences. This makes it easy for even
          those unfamiliar with coding or programming to use and benefit from
          ChatGPT AI. 
          <br />
          <br />
          For example, if a user asks the chatbot to book a hotel room,
          it can understand the request and provide a list of options based on
          the user's specified criteria. This level of functionality adds an
          extra level of convenience and saves users time and effort.
